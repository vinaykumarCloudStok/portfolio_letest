                  Face serums are a skincare product that are designed to be applied to the skin before moisturizer, and they typically contain a high concentration of active ingredients. They can be used to target specific skin concerns, such as fine lines and wrinkles, uneven skin tone, and dehydrated skin.
                  One of the key benefits of using a face serum is that they are able to penetrate the skin more deeply than other skincare products, such as moisturizers or lotions. This is because serums are formulated with smaller molecules, which allows them to penetrate the skin more easily and deliver their active ingredients more effectively.
