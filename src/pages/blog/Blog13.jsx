                  <p className='new-b-para'>

                  Serums are lightweight, fast-absorbing liquids that are designed to target specific skin concerns such as hydration, brightening, and anti-aging. They are typically formulated with high concentrations of active ingredients, such as vitamin C and hyaluronic acid, which are able to penetrate deep into the skin. Serums are usually applied after cleansing and toning, and before moisturizing.

                  Oils, on the other hand, are typically used as a moisturizer or a sealant. They are formulated with a blend of different oils that are designed to provide hydration, nourishment, and protection to the skin. Oils can be used on their own as a moisturizer or as a sealant to lock in the benefits of other products such as serums. They can be applied after cleansing, toning and serum application.
